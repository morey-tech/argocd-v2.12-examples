# What's New in Argo CD v2.12?

Try out the demos for yourself by opening up this repo in a Codespace, which will create a Kubernetes cluster with k3d and deploy Argo CD v2.12. You can then open the UI in a new window with port-forwarding from the Codespace, and use the pre-configured `argocd` CLI!

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/morey-tech/argocd-v2.12-examples)

Get the `admin` password for the UI from:
```
cat ~/argo-cd-admin-password.txt
```
